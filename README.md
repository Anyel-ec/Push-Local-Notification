## Dependencies

Below are the main dependencies used in this project:

- **equatable**: ^2.0.5
- **firebase_core**: ^2.30.1
- **firebase_messaging**: ^14.9.1
- **flutter**: sdk: flutter
- **flutter_bloc**: ^8.1.5
- **go_router**: ^14.0.1

## Setup

1. Make sure you have all the mentioned dependencies installed in your Flutter project.
2. Set up your project in Firebase and download the `google-services.json` file. Make sure it's placed correctly in the `android/app` folder of your project.
3. Modify the `firebase_options.dart` file with your Firebase configuration options.
4. Ensure you have correctly imported all necessary files and configured the routes in `app_router.dart`.

## Implementation

The project consists of several key parts:

- **main.dart**: This file is the entry point of the application. Firebase is initialized here, and `FirebaseMessaging.onBackgroundMessage` is configured to handle notifications in the background.
- **notifications_bloc.dart**: This file defines the `NotificationsBloc`, which manages the state of notifications and handles notification-related events.
- **home_screen.dart**: The main screen of the application, displaying the list of received notifications and providing options to configure notifications.
- **details_screen.dart**: A screen to view the details of a specific notification.

## Usage

1. Run the application on a device or emulator compatible with Flutter.
2. The main screen will display the received notifications.
3. You can tap on a notification to view more details.
4. Use the settings icon on the navigation bar to adjust the notification settings.
